2. Creating a Functional React Component Gallery

Problem Statement: Develop a webpage that displays an image gallery. The gallery will consist of several 
individual images, each represented by its own functional component. This assignment is designed to help 
you grasp the basics of functional component creation and rendering in React.



Task 1: Create Multiple Image Components



Write three separate functional components, each displaying a different image. Name these components ImageOne, 
ImageTwo, and ImageThree. Use placeholder images from a service like https://placeholder.co.


Expected Outcome: Three functional components, each rendering a distinct placeholder image, demonstrating the 
capability to create and manage multiple functional components in React.



Task 2: Assemble the Gallery



In your App component, import and render all three image components to create the gallery.


Expected Outcome: A cohesive image gallery within the App component, consisting of the three individual image 
components rendered together. This task should solidify your understanding of basic component integration within 
a React application. -->
